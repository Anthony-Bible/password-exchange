# Hexagonal Architecture Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the complete plan for refactoring the Password Exchange application to use hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture.

## Overview

**Goal:** Transform the current monolithic command structure into a clean hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns, improved testability, and better maintainability.

**Approach:** Incremental refactoring maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process.

## âœ… COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Create Hexagonal Directory Structure âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED

Created the foundation directory structure following hexagonal architecture principles:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/                    # Private application code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                  # Cross-cutting concerns
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/             # Configuration management
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logging/            # Structured logging (placeholder)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validation/         # Common validation utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ domains/                # Business domains
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ message/            # Core message sharing domain
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ encryption/         # Cryptographic operations domain
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ storage/            # Data persistence domain
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ notification/       # Communication domain
â””â”€â”€ pkg/                        # Public interfaces
    â”œâ”€â”€ pb/                     # Generated protobuf code
    â””â”€â”€ clients/                # Service clients
```

Each domain follows the hexagonal pattern:
- `domain/` - Business entities & rules
- `ports/primary/` - Inbound interfaces (web, gRPC)
- `ports/secondary/` - Outbound interfaces (database, external services)
- `adapters/primary/` - Inbound implementations
- `adapters/secondary/` - Outbound implementations

### Phase 2: Move Shared Components âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED

Relocated shared utilities and configuration:
- âœ… `app/config/` â†’ `app/internal/shared/config/`
- âœ… `app/commons/` â†’ `app/internal/shared/validation/` (renamed to env.go)
- âœ… `app/message/` â†’ `app/internal/domains/message/domain/entities.go`
- âœ… Updated all import paths across codebase
- âœ… Verified builds work after moves

### Phase 3: Organize Generated Code âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED

Moved protobuf files to clean pkg structure:
- âœ… `app/databasepb/` â†’ `app/pkg/pb/database/`
- âœ… `app/encryptionpb/` â†’ `app/pkg/pb/encryption/`
- âœ… `app/messagepb/` â†’ `app/pkg/pb/message/`
- âœ… Updated import paths in all consuming files
- âœ… Updated build scripts for new structure

### Phase 4: Update Build System âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED

Updated build scripts and Docker configuration:
- âœ… Modified `test-build.sh` for new protobuf generation paths
- âœ… Verified Docker builds work with new structure
- âœ… Updated documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- âœ… Added proper .gitignore entries
- âœ… All builds tested and working

## Benefits Achieved So Far

âœ… **Clean Code Organization** - Clear separation between business logic, infrastructure, and interfaces
âœ… **Build System Compatibility** - All existing build processes work with new structure
âœ… **Backward Compatibility** - No breaking changes to existing functionality
âœ… **Documentation** - Architecture guidance in CLAUDE.md
âœ… **Testability Foundation** - Structure ready for comprehensive testing
âœ… **Technology Independence** - Generated code separated from business logic

## Benefits After Completion

ðŸŽ¯ **Independent Deployability** - Each domain can be deployed separately
ðŸŽ¯ **Technology Flexibility** - Easy to swap databases, frameworks, etc.
ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Testability** - Mock adapters for isolated unit testing
ðŸŽ¯ **Clear Boundaries** - Explicit separation of concerns
ðŸŽ¯ **Maintainability** - Changes in one domain don't affect others
ðŸŽ¯ **Team Scalability** - Different teams can own different domains

## Migration Strategy

**Incremental Approach:**
1. Extract one domain at a time (start with least coupled)
2. Create tests for ports before implementing adapters  
3. Keep old structure working during migration
4. Validate each step with comprehensive testing

**Recommended Order:**
1. Storage domain (most foundational)
2. Encryption domain (clear boundaries) 
3. Notification domain (fewer dependencies)
4. Message domain (most complex, do last)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each phase can be done independently
- Rollback capability at each step
- Maintain existing functionality throughout
- Comprehensive testing at each milestone
