## ðŸŸ¡ Major Issues

### Database Migration
- [ ] Add proper migration versioning system
- [ ] Create rollback script for email_reminders table migration
- [ ] Consider using a migration framework instead of manual SQL files
- [ ] Review CASCADE delete implications and ensure proper cleanup logic
- [ ] Document migration deployment procedure

### Error Handling
- [ ] Define clear error handling strategy for partial failures
- [ ] Determine if reminder job should fail completely or continue on individual message errors
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns across reminder functionality
- [ ] Add proper error recovery mechanisms

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues

### Code Organization
- [ ] Move `ReminderProcessor` from CLI command to domain layer
- [ ] Follow hexagonal architecture patterns for reminder business logic
- [ ] Extract reminder processing to `internal/domains/notification/`
- [ ] Centralize configuration loading logic
- [ ] Use existing config patterns instead of custom loading

### Protocol Buffers
- [ ] Review proto field naming consistency (snake_case vs camelCase)
- [ ] Ensure proto definitions follow project conventions
- [ ] Validate protobuf field numbering and backwards compatibility

### Logging & Privacy
- [x] Mask email addresses in logs for privacy compliance âœ…
  - *Completed: All email addresses now masked in logs across all domains*
- [x] Review all log statements for potentially sensitive data âœ…
  - *Completed: Comprehensive review of 20+ logging locations across reminder system*
- [x] Implement structured logging for reminder operations âœ…
  - *Completed: Using zerolog structured logging with consistent field names*
- [x] Add appropriate log levels for different scenarios âœ…
  - *Completed: Proper log levels (Debug, Info, Error) applied throughout reminder processing*

## ðŸŽ¯ Architecture & Testing

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Add unit tests for ReminderProcessor following TDD principles
- [ ] Create tests for reminder configuration loading
- [ ] Add integration tests for database reminder operations
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Add tests for protobuf message handling

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Move business logic from CLI command to domain layer
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection for reminder services
- [ ] Follow ports and adapters pattern consistently
- [ ] Ensure domain layer has no external dependencies
- [ ] Review service interfaces and implementations

## ðŸ”§ Implementation & Documentation

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follow conventional commit message standards for future commits
- [ ] Split large commit into smaller, focused commits
- [ ] Add comprehensive code comments where needed
- [ ] Review variable naming and code readability

### Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Document reminder configuration options
- [ ] Add deployment instructions for reminder cronjob
- [ ] Update API documentation if needed
- [ ] Document database schema changes

### Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Validate environment variable handling
- [ ] Test configuration in different deployment scenarios
- [ ] Ensure proper default values for all settings
- [ ] Document required vs optional configuration parameters
